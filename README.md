ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrKaranJ. I am an Electrical Engineer working on Automotive Radar Signal Processing. I am interested in anything tech and enjoy sports, music and reading. 

I am currently trying to setup my personal website and learning the basics of neural networks. I would love to collaborate on any projects related to machine learning or signal processing.

You can reach me via email at mail@karanjayachandra.com or on LinkedIn at /mrkaranj.
